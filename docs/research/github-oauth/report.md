# GitHub OAuth Authentication for Android Apps: Current Best Practice (2025-2026)

**Date:** 2026-02-09

## Executive Summary

Yes, OAuth with PKCE via Custom Chrome Tabs is the recommended approach for Android apps authenticating with GitHub -- but with two important caveats that make GitHub's implementation more complex than the textbook OAuth-for-mobile flow:

1. **GitHub still requires `client_secret` even when using PKCE.** Unlike most modern OAuth providers, GitHub does not distinguish between public and confidential clients. You must include the secret in the token exchange, and PKCE is an *additional* protection layer, not a replacement for the secret.

2. **GitHub only accepts HTTPS callback URLs** -- not custom URI schemes like `myapp://callback`. This means a pure client-side redirect flow on Android is not straightforward; you need either a backend intermediary or Android App Links with a verified HTTPS domain.

Given these constraints, **the recommended architecture for a production app is: Custom Tabs + PKCE + a lightweight backend that handles the token exchange and redirect.** For a personal/small-scale app where the security stakes are lower, shipping the `client_secret` in the app code (as GitHub explicitly suggests) combined with PKCE is acceptable.

## Answers to Your Specific Questions

### 1. Is OAuth with PKCE via Custom Chrome Tabs still the recommended approach?

**Yes.** This aligns with both GitHub's guidance and the broader industry standard (RFC 8252).

- GitHub added PKCE support on **July 14, 2025** for both OAuth Apps and GitHub Apps.
- RFC 8252 ("OAuth 2.0 for Native Apps") mandates using an external user-agent -- Custom Tabs on Android -- rather than embedded WebViews.
- The AppAuth-Android library (OpenID Foundation) is the reference implementation of RFC 8252 and supports Custom Tabs + PKCE.
- GitHub's own best practices doc says to use "authorization code with PKCE" and calls it "preferable" over the device flow for public clients.

### 2. Does GitHub support PKCE for OAuth Apps, or only GitHub Apps?

**Both.** PKCE works with both OAuth Apps and GitHub Apps. The July 2025 changelog explicitly states: "Both GitHub Apps and OAuth apps should use PKCE with the authorization code flow."

Only the **S256** code challenge method is accepted (plain is not supported).

PKCE is currently optional -- GitHub is "not requiring PKCE for any authentication flow at this time" -- but it is strongly recommended.

### 3. Is there a client secret involved, and is it safe to embed in a mobile app?

**Yes, `client_secret` is required.** This is the biggest wrinkle in GitHub's mobile OAuth story.

GitHub's token exchange endpoint (`POST https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token`) lists `client_secret` as **required**, even when you include the PKCE `code_verifier`. PKCE adds protection but does not replace the secret.

GitHub's official guidance is blunt about this:

> "If your app is a public client (a native app that runs on the user's device, CLI utility, or single-page web application), you cannot secure your client secret. You will have to ship the client secret in the application's code, and you should use PKCE to better secure the authentication flow."

**How dangerous is a leaked client secret?** GitHub's community docs clarify that the secret alone is not catastrophic -- "The client secret can only be used to manipulate a token someone has in possession -- there's nothing it can do without a token." However, they warn: "you should use caution if you plan to gate access to your own services based on tokens generated by your app because public clients are trivially spoofable -- anyone can reuse your app's client ID to sign in."

Removing the `client_secret` requirement for public clients is reportedly on GitHub's roadmap, but as of February 2026, it has not shipped.

**Three approaches to handle this:**

| Approach | Security | Complexity | Best For |
|----------|----------|------------|----------|
| Ship secret in app + PKCE | Moderate (GitHub's official suggestion) | Low | Personal/small apps |
| Backend proxy for token exchange | High (secret never leaves server) | Medium-High | Production apps with a backend |
| Device flow (no secret needed) | Moderate (phishing risk) | Low | CLIs, headless; discouraged for mobile |

### 4. What is the exact OAuth flow GitHub supports for mobile/native apps?

**Authorization Code Grant with PKCE** -- the same flow as web apps, with the PKCE extension. Here are the exact steps:

**Step 1: Generate PKCE parameters**
- Generate a random `code_verifier` (43-128 character string)
- Compute `code_challenge = BASE64URL(SHA256(code_verifier))`

**Step 2: Open authorization URL in Custom Tab**
```
GET https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize
  ?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
  &redirect_uri=https://your-domain.com/callback    (HTTPS only!)
  &scope=repo,user                                    (as needed)
  &state=RANDOM_STATE_STRING
  &code_challenge=BASE64URL_SHA256_HASH
  &code_challenge_method=S256
```

**Step 3: User authorizes in browser, GitHub redirects to your callback URL with a `code`**

**Step 4: Exchange code for token**
```
POST https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token
  client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
  client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET                    (required!)
  code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE
  redirect_uri=https://your-domain.com/callback
  code_verifier=ORIGINAL_CODE_VERIFIER
```

**Important redirect URI constraint:** GitHub only accepts HTTPS callback URLs. Custom URI schemes (`myapp://callback`) are not supported. For Android, this means you need one of:
- An HTTPS endpoint on your backend that receives the redirect and forwards to the app (via Android App Links or custom scheme)
- Android App Links with a verified domain that intercepts the HTTPS redirect directly

### 5. Are there newer/better alternatives?

| Alternative | Verdict |
|------------|---------|
| **GitHub App (vs. OAuth App)** | Preferred by GitHub. Same auth flow, but offers fine-grained permissions, short-lived tokens (1hr), and better repo access control. Use this if creating a new app. |
| **Device Flow** | Avoids client_secret entirely, but GitHub explicitly discourages it for mobile apps (phishing risk from lacking redirect URI binding). Only use for CLIs/IoT. |
| **Fine-grained PATs** | Only viable for single-user personal apps. Manually generated, tied to one user, no OAuth flow. Could work if you just need API access for yourself. |
| **Classic PATs** | Worse than fine-grained PATs in every way. Avoid. |

**Recommendation:** Use a **GitHub App** (not an OAuth App) with the authorization code + PKCE flow. GitHub Apps are the newer, more secure option with finer permissions and short-lived tokens.

### 6. What does official GitHub documentation recommend for native/mobile apps?

GitHub's best practices page is the most explicit guidance. In summary:

1. **Use authorization code flow with PKCE** -- preferred over all alternatives for mobile
2. **Ship the client secret in the app** -- acknowledged as unavoidable for public clients
3. **Do NOT use the device flow** for mobile apps that can use a browser -- it's a phishing vector
4. **Be cautious about trusting tokens from public clients** -- anyone can spoof your app's client_id
5. **Use PKCE to mitigate** the risk of the exposed client_secret

GitHub does not provide Android-specific implementation guidance (no mention of Custom Tabs, App Links, etc.). For that, you follow RFC 8252 and the AppAuth-Android library.

## Recommended Architecture for Your Android App

Given your existing AWS backend infrastructure, here is the approach I would recommend:

```
Android App                          Your AWS Backend              GitHub
    |                                      |                         |
    |-- 1. Open Custom Tab --------------->|                         |
    |   (github.com/login/oauth/authorize) |                         |
    |   with PKCE code_challenge           |                         |
    |                                      |                         |
    |                    2. User authorizes on GitHub ------>         |
    |                                      |                         |
    |<---- 3. Redirect to https://your-api.com/auth/callback -------|
    |        (with authorization code)     |                         |
    |                                      |                         |
    |   4. Backend receives code,          |                         |
    |      exchanges for token             |--- POST access_token -->|
    |      (client_secret stays on server) |<-- token ---------------|
    |                                      |                         |
    |<---- 5. Backend redirects to app ----|                         |
    |      (via App Links or custom scheme)|                         |
    |      with token or session           |                         |
```

This keeps the `client_secret` on your backend (never shipped in the APK), uses Custom Tabs per RFC 8252, and works with GitHub's HTTPS-only callback requirement since your backend provides the HTTPS endpoint.

For a **simpler personal-use approach** where you accept shipping the secret:
1. Register your GitHub App/OAuth App with an HTTPS callback URL on a simple backend (even a Lambda function)
2. The backend receives the callback, does the token exchange with the secret, and redirects to your Android app
3. Use PKCE for additional protection
