## Short Description

Capture thoughts instantly — voice notes pushed straight to your GitHub repo.


## Full Description

Note Taker is built on a simple idea: when a thought hits you, you should be able to capture it in seconds — no navigating, no typing. Press a button, speak, done.

How it works
Your notes are pushed as markdown files to a GitHub repository you control. Each note lands in your repo's inbox folder — plain text you own, ready to organize however you like.

Instant capture from any state
Set Note Taker as your digital assistant and long-press the side button to start recording. Voice recognition starts immediately so you can speak your thought before it slips away.

Your notes, your repo
Notes live as plain markdown files in a GitHub repository you own. No proprietary format, no vendor lock-in. Browse them in the app, on GitHub, or with any text editor. Full version history comes free with git.

Privacy by design
• Notes go directly to YOUR GitHub repo via HTTPS
• Speech recognition handled by your device's built-in speech service
• No analytics, no ads, no tracking
• No third-party services beyond the GitHub API
• Your GitHub token is stored locally in app-private storage

Features
• Voice-first input with continuous listening
• One-tap submission to GitHub
• Offline note queuing with automatic retry
• Repository browser with markdown rendering
• Current topic display from your repo
• Quick capture via side button
• Dark theme

Getting started
Create a blank GitHub repository for your notes (any name works), then create a fine-grained personal access token with Contents read/write permission scoped to that repo. The app walks you through the rest.
