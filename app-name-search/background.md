## Research Log

---

### Search: site:play.google.com "Breve" app

- **BREVE V1.0** exists on Google Play as a niche ESC (electronic speed controller) app for RC racing ([BREVE V1.0][1])
- **Breve - Delivery app** exists on Google Play, appears to be a delivery/shopping app ([Breve Delivery][2])
- Several similar-sounding apps clutter the space: **Breev** (AI bookmarks), **Brevent** (app standby), **Brave Browser** (100M+ users)
- The Brave Browser is the dominant similar-sounding app and could cause confusion/SEO competition

### Search: "Breve" android app play store

- Confirmed **BREVE V1.0** is the main exact-match result on Play Store ([BREVE V1.0][1])
- **Brevo** (formerly Sendinblue) is a major CRM/email platform with its own Play Store developer page, similar name ([Brevo][8])
- No dominant, highly popular app called exactly "Breve" on Android

### Search: "Breve" app

- **Breve Video Updates** is a product for remote teams (pre-recorded video updates), has presence on AppSumo and its own domain brevevideo.com ([AppSumo][3], [Breve Video][4])
- **Breve Data Visualization** is a Stanford-affiliated research tool for tabular data ([Stanford BREVE][5])
- **Breve newsletter-to-podcast** app exists at app.breve.to ([Breve Newsletter][6])
- **Breve Delivery App** has an Instagram presence ([Breve Delivery IG][7])
- The name "Breve" is moderately crowded across the app/product space -- at least 4-5 distinct products use this name
- **Key concern:** Proximity to "Brave Browser" (100M+ users) could hurt discoverability in search results

**Follow-up questions:** None needed for Breve -- picture is clear. Move to Dictum.

---

### Search: site:play.google.com "Dictum" app

- **DICTUM** exists on Google Play as a catalog app for a German tools/crafts company (dictum.com) ([DICTUM tools][10])
- **DICTUM Law coaching** is a law education app on Google Play ([DICTUM Law][11])
- **Dictum Judicial Academy** is another legal education app on Google Play ([Dictum Judicial][12])
- **Diktum** (alternate spelling) is also on Google Play ([Diktum][9])
- Multiple Google Play Books results use "dictum" in titles (Latin word, common in legal/academic contexts)

### Search: "Dictum" android app play store

- Confirmed the law coaching and tools catalog apps on Play Store
- **Dictum - Speak Sharper** exists on iOS (not Android yet), a vocabulary/speech improvement app ([Dictum Speak Sharper][13])
- **Dictum Technologies** is a software development company ([Dictum Technologies][16])
- An APK for a time-tracking "Dictum" app also found on apkpure.com

### Search: "Dictum" app

- **Dictum - Speak Sharper** is the most prominent app product using this name -- iOS app for improving speech/vocabulary with daily lessons ([Dictum Speak Sharper][13], [Dictum App website][14])
- Has its own domain (dictum-app.com) and Instagram presence (@dictum_app)
- **Dictum iOS dictionary app** exists as an open-source project on GitHub ([GitHub Dictum][15])
- **DICTUM** (dictum.com) is an established German e-commerce brand for premium tools and craft supplies ([DICTUM tools][17])
- The name is moderately crowded: at least 4 apps on Google Play + 1 iOS app + a major commerce brand
- **Key concern:** "Dictum - Speak Sharper" is in a similar category (language/speech) which could create direct confusion if your app is note-taking/voice related
- **Key concern:** "dictum" is a common Latin/legal term, so it appears in many unrelated search results, diluting discoverability

**Follow-up questions:** None needed for Dictum. Move to Vocable.

---

### Search: site:play.google.com "Vocable" app

- **Vocable AAC** exists on Google Play -- a communication tool for speech-impaired individuals using head tracking, developed by WillowTree ([Vocable AAC][18])
- **Vocable** exists on Google Play as a language-learning app (read international press with word translations every 15 days) ([Vocable language][19])
- **Vocable Chain** is a word puzzle game on Google Play ([Vocable Chain][20])
- There is a **dedicated developer page** for "Vocable" on Google Play ([Vocable developer][21])

### Search: "Vocable" android app play store

- **Vocable AAC** is an open-source project with a dedicated GitHub repo for Android, developed by WillowTree (a well-known agency) ([Vocable GitHub][23])
- Featured by TELUS Digital, indicating meaningful press coverage ([TELUS Digital][24])
- **Vocable** (language learning) has its own website vocable.app ([Vocable website][22])
- The name has strong presence: two established apps both called "Vocable" on the Play Store

### Search: "Vocable" app

- **Vocable AAC** is the dominant product -- free, open-source, has press coverage, featured on Apple Vision Pro ([Vocable AAC][18], [Vision Pro][26])
- **Vocable AI** is a separate product -- an AI content marketing automation platform at vocable.ai ([Vocable AI][25])
- **Vocable** language learning app has vocable.app domain ([Vocable website][22])
- The name is the **most crowded of the three**: two established Play Store apps, a developer page, an AI SaaS product, and meaningful press coverage
- **Key concern:** Vocable AAC is a heartfelt accessibility product with real press coverage -- competing for the name could look bad
- **Key concern:** The developer page "Vocable" already exists on Google Play, meaning someone has claimed the developer name

**Follow-up questions:** Check download counts / ratings for the Vocable apps to gauge how established they are.
