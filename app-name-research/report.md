# App Name Availability Report - Google Play Store

**Date:** 2026-02-12

## Summary

Of the 8 candidate names, **Utterance** is the clear winner for discoverability -- it has zero competing apps on the Play Store. **Inkwell** is the runner-up with light competition from small apps. Everything else is crowded to varying degrees, with **Jot**, **Quill**, **Jotter**, and **Dispatch** being the most problematic.

## Comparison

| Name | Crowding Level | Direct Note/Voice Competitor? | Biggest Threat | Recommendation |
|------|---------------|-------------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Utterance** | Empty | No | None | Best choice |
| **Inkwell** | Light | Yes (small note app) | "Inkwell note app" exists but appears small | Viable |
| **Blurt** | Moderate | No (study app is adjacent) | Blurt: Blurting Study Method (4.8 stars, 928 reviews) | Possible but contested |
| **Dispatch** | Very Heavy | No | 10+ logistics/delivery apps dominate the name | Avoid |
| **Murmur** | Heavy | Yes (voice diary) | "Murmur - Voice Diary" with transcription/summarization | Avoid |
| **Jot** | Very Heavy | Yes (multiple) | 6+ apps named "Jot", several are note-taking apps | Avoid |
| **Quill** | Very Heavy | Yes (Quillpad) | QuillBot (major brand), Quillpad (FOSS note app) | Avoid |
| **Jotter** | Very Heavy | Yes (multiple) | "Jotter" AI note app, JotterPad, One Jotter, Jotter Lite Pro | Avoid |

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Utterance -- CLEAR

No app named "Utterance" exists on the Google Play Store. The word only appears in search results as a technical term in speech recognition documentation and in book titles. The only tangentially related thing is "utterances" (utteranc.es), which is a GitHub-based blog commenting widget -- not a mobile app and not a competitor.

The name has a natural connection to voice/speech that fits a voice-first note-taking app, and it would have no competition in Play Store search results.

### 2. Inkwell -- LIGHTLY CROWDED

A few apps use the name, but none are dominant:
- An "Inkwell note app" exists on the Play Store, described as a tool for capturing and organizing ideas. It appears to be small/low-profile.
- Inkwell (AI Learning) uses ChatGPT for lesson creation -- different category.
- InkWell Health is a health tracking app -- completely unrelated.
- Inkwell Keyboard is a lightweight keyboard app.
- Inkwell Journal exists on iOS but was not found on the Android Play Store.

The note app overlap is a concern, but the competitive landscape is thin compared to the other names on this list. The Inkwell note app does not appear to be well-established.

### 3. Blurt -- MODERATELY CROWDED

The main competitor is **Blurt: Blurting Study Method**, a well-rated study app (4.8 stars, 928 reviews, last updated July 2025). It is not a note-taking app, but it is in the adjacent education/productivity space. The domain blurt.app is also taken by a web writing tool. BlurtKey exists for the Blurt blockchain. There was a "Blurt" audio social networking app in 2012 that appears to be defunct.

Not as bad as Jot or Quill, but the study app has real traction and the name has existing associations.

### 4. Dispatch -- VERY CROWDED (wrong domain)

The word "Dispatch" is completely dominated by logistics, delivery, and fleet management apps. There are easily 10+ apps with "Dispatch" in their name: DISPATCHIT, Dispatch Field, Dispatch Manager, Dispatch Anywhere, DispatchTrack, Super Dispatch, Dispatch Science, GTS Dispatch, ALS Dispatch, and more. There is also a Dispatch strategy game and a Dispatch Launcher for Android TV.

None are note-taking apps, but the name is so saturated with logistics associations that a note-taking app would be invisible in search results and confusing to users.

### 5. Murmur -- CROWDED with a direct competitor

The most damaging finding here: **Murmur - Voice Diary** is a private voice diary app with transcription, summarization, and emotional analysis. This is almost exactly the same concept as a voice-first note-taking app. Beyond that, there are 6+ other apps named Murmur across anonymous chat, Bluetooth calls, ambient sounds, digital signage, and medical education.

### 6. Jot -- VERY CROWDED

At least 6 apps use "Jot" as their primary name, and several are directly in the note-taking space:
- Jot: Floating Notes & Notepad (quick note-taking with floating window)
- Jot (encrypted, offline-first journal with AI)
- Jot - Notes and chats, with AI
- Jot Journal (AI-driven journaling)
- Plus Jot App (NFC profiles), Jot ERP, JOT IT, Jott, and the massive Jotform brand

This name is thoroughly claimed in the exact category you need.

### 7. Quill -- VERY CROWDED

Dominated by **QuillBot**, a major AI writing assistant brand with wide recognition. **Quillpad** is an actively maintained open-source markdown note-taking app (a fork of Quillnote) with voice recording support. There was also a historical "Quill" handwriting note-taking app for Android (now discontinued). Additional apps include Quill PDF Chat, Quill e-learning, Quill Type, and several others.

The "Quill" concept is so heavily associated with writing tools that any new app with this name would struggle for visibility.

### 8. Jotter -- VERY CROWDED

The word "jotter" literally means a small notebook, so it has been used extensively:
- **Jotter - AI Note Taking App** (the-jotter.com) is a cross-platform AI note app using Google Gemini, available on iOS, Android, Web, WhatsApp, and Chrome. This is a direct, active competitor.
- **JotterPad** is a well-established professional writing app for screenwriters and authors.
- **One Jotter - Notes & Journal** is a free note-taking app.
- **Jotter Lite Pro** is an ad-free notepad.
- The original **Jotter - Notes Writing App** is being discontinued but still listed.

This is one of the worst options -- multiple apps with the exact name in the exact note-taking category, including an AI-powered one.

## Recommendation

**Utterance** stands alone as the only name with zero competition on the Play Store. It also has a natural semantic connection to voice input, which fits a voice-first note-taking app well. The tradeoff is that it is a longer, more formal-sounding word -- but for discoverability purposes, it is far ahead of every other option on this list.

**Inkwell** is the only other viable option if you want something more concise, though it does have a small existing note app to contend with.

Every other name on this list has significant competition, either from apps in the same note-taking space or from such heavy general usage that discoverability would be poor.
