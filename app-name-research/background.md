## Research Log

<!-- Search entries will be appended below -->

---

### Search: site:play.google.com "Jot" app

**Extremely crowded.** Multiple apps use the exact name "Jot":
- **Jot: Floating Notes & Notepad** - a note-taking app with floating window ([Jot: Floating Notes][1])
- **Boogie Board Jot** - official companion app for Boogie Board hardware ([Boogie Board Jot][2])
- **Jot** (encrypted journal) - encrypted, offline-first journal with AI ([Jot encrypted][3])
- **Jot - Notes and chats, with AI** - notes and conversations app ([Jot AI][4])
- **Jot App** - NFC-based profile sharing app ([Jot App][5])
- **Jot Journal** - AI-driven journaling app ([Jot Journal][6])
- Also: Jot ERP, JOT IT, Jott, Jotform

**Verdict: VERY CROWDED.** At least 6 apps with "Jot" as the primary name, several in the note-taking space directly.

---

### Search: "Jot" android app play store note taking

Confirmed the above findings. **Jot: Floating Notes & Notepad** appears to be the most prominent, with a floating window feature for quick note-taking. All notes stored locally. The app appears well-reviewed and actively maintained. This is a direct competitor in the same note-taking space.

---

### Search: site:play.google.com "Blurt" app

**Moderately crowded.** Found these apps:
- **Blurt: Blurting Study Method** - AI-powered study recall tool, 4.8 stars with 928 reviews, updated July 2025 ([Blurt Study][7])
- **BlurtKey** - wallet for Blurt blockchain accounts ([BlurtKey][8])
- Several business plan apps from a "blurt" developer (Business Ideas, Business Plan Quick Builder, etc.)
- Most other results were "Blur" apps (photo editors), not "Blurt"

Also found **blurt.app** exists as a web writing tool ([Blurt web app][9]), and there was a **Blurt audio social networking app** back in 2012 ([Blurt 2012][10]) that appears defunct.

**Verdict: MODERATELY CROWDED.** The name "Blurt" is taken by a well-rated study app, but fewer direct competitors than "Jot." Not in the note-taking space specifically, but the study app is adjacent. The blurt.app domain is also taken.

---

### Search: "Blurt" android app play store

Confirmed above. The **Blurt: Blurting Study Method** app is the main competitor - 4.8 rating, 928 reviews, actively maintained. BlurtKey is niche (blockchain). The Blurt blockchain social platform also has apps. Not as crowded as Jot but the name has existing associations.

---

### Search: site:play.google.com "Murmur" app

**Crowded across diverse categories.** Multiple apps use the exact name "Murmur":
- **Murmur - Anonymous Post, Chat** - anonymous social app with encryption ([Murmur Anon][11])
- **Murmur - Voice Diary** - private voice diary with transcription, summarization, emotional analysis ([Murmur Voice Diary][12]) -- **THIS IS VERY CLOSE TO OUR USE CASE (voice + notes)**
- **Murmur: Bluetooth Group Calls** - short-range group voice calls over BLE ([Murmur BT][13])
- **A Soft Murmur** - ambient sound mixer for focus/relaxation ([A Soft Murmur][14])
- **Murmur Signage Player** - digital signage for businesses ([Murmur Signage][15])
- **Murmur (Medical Education)** - MBBS study app ([Murmur Med][16])
- Also: Mama Murmur, MURMUR BEACH, aMurmur voice chat, Murmur Games

**Verdict: CROWDED, and one direct competitor.** The "Murmur - Voice Diary" app is extremely close to a voice-first note-taking app. This would be a problematic name collision.

---

### Search: "Murmur" android app play store

Confirmed above. The **Murmur - Voice Diary** is the most concerning overlap -- it's a voice diary with transcription and summarization, which is very similar to a voice-first note-taking app. Multiple other Murmur apps exist across different categories.

---

### Search: site:play.google.com "Dispatch" app

**Very crowded, but in a completely different domain.** The name "Dispatch" is heavily used by logistics/delivery/fleet management apps:
- **Dispatch** (DISPATCHIT) - delivery professional app ([Dispatch][17])
- **Dispatch Field** - service technician app ([Dispatch Field][18])
- **Dispatch Manager** - workforce scheduling app ([Dispatch Manager][19])
- **Dispatch Anywhere Mobile** - business dispatch management
- **Dispatch Science Driver App** - courier delivery management
- Also: DispatchTrack, Super Dispatch, GTS Dispatch, ALS Dispatch, Field Service Dispatch

**Verdict: EXTREMELY CROWDED** but entirely in the logistics/delivery space. No note-taking apps, but the word is so strongly associated with dispatching/delivery that it would be confusing and hard to rank for.

---

### Search: "Dispatch" android app play store

Found additional uses:
- **Dispatch Launcher** - Android TV launcher integrating with Plex
- **Dispatch Mobile Workflow** - transport mission management
- **Dispatch** (strategy game) - story-driven superhero dispatch center game ([Dispatch game][20])

The name is thoroughly claimed across logistics, enterprise, and even gaming. While none are note-taking apps, the extreme crowding would make discoverability very difficult.

---

### Search: site:play.google.com "Quill" app

**Very crowded, especially in writing/education space.** Multiple apps:
- **Quill - The Padhai App** - e-learning platform ([Quill Padhai][21])
- **Quill - PDF and Document Chat** - AI research assistant for PDFs ([Quill PDF][22])
- **QuillBot: AI Writing Assistant** - major writing tool, very popular ([QuillBot][23])
- **Quillpad** - open-source markdown note-taking app ([Quillpad][24])
- **Quill Type** - keyboard/typing app ([Quill Type][25])
- Also: Quill Plus (test management), myQuill (energy), Quill Arrow Law, Quill Choice

**Verdict: VERY CROWDED.** QuillBot is a massive, well-known brand. Quillpad is an open-source note-taking app directly in the same space. The "Quill" concept is heavily associated with writing tools already.

---

### Search: "Quill" android app play store note writing

Confirmed above. Additional findings:
- **Quill** was also the name of a historical open-source handwriting note-taking app for Android tablets (now discontinued, available on GitHub)
- **Quillpad** is a fork of Quillnote, actively maintained, fully FOSS with markdown support, task lists, voice recordings, and Nextcloud sync
- **QuillBot** is a major AI writing assistant brand

The writing/note-taking space is saturated with "Quill" variants. This name would get lost.

---

### Search: site:play.google.com "Inkwell" app

**Lightly crowded.** Found these apps:
- **Inkwell** (AI Learning) - uses ChatGPT to create tailored lessons ([Inkwell AI][26])
- **InkWell Health** - health recovery tracking through temporary tattoos ([InkWell Health][27])
- **Inkwell Keyboard** - lightweight keyboard app ([Inkwell Keyboard][28])
- **Inkwell note app** - described as a tool for capturing, organizing and sharing ideas ([Inkwell note][29])
- Most other results were books and movies on Google Play, not apps

**Verdict: MODERATELY CROWDED.** There IS an "Inkwell note app" directly in the notes space. However, the overall field is less crowded than Jot or Quill. The apps that do exist seem smaller/less established.

---

### Search: "Inkwell" android app play store

Additional findings:
- **Inkwell** (reading app) - clean minimal reading app ([Inkwell reader][30])
- **Inkwell Journal** exists on iOS App Store (not found on Play Store)
- **Inkwell** doodling app exists (Kotlin-based, on SourceForge/GitHub)
- **Inkwell Customizable Ebooks** on iOS

Less competition on Android Play Store than other names checked so far. The note app exists but seems small. The name has fewer established associations on the Play Store.

---

### Search: site:play.google.com "Jotter" app

**Very crowded in the note-taking space specifically.** Multiple direct competitors:
- **Jotter - Notes Writing App** - being discontinued, no further updates ([Jotter Notes][31])
- **Jotter Mobile Working** - data capture/mobile working solution ([Jotter Mobile][32])
- **JotterPad - Writer, Screenplay** - professional text editor for writers, well-known app ([JotterPad][33])
- **One Jotter - Notes & Journal** - notebook/notepad app with folders, tags, favorites ([One Jotter][34])
- **Jotter Lite Pro - A Notepad** - ad-free notepad app ([Jotter Lite Pro][35])
- **School Jotter 3** and **School Jotter** - school communication apps

**Verdict: VERY CROWDED in the exact note-taking space.** JotterPad is a well-established brand. Multiple other "Jotter" note apps exist or have existed. The word "jotter" literally means a small notebook, so it has been heavily used.

---

### Search: "Jotter" android app play store notes

Confirmed and expanded:
- **Jotter - AI Note Taking App** ([the-jotter.com][36]) - exists as a cross-platform AI note-taking app using Google Gemini for auto-categorization, available on iOS, Android, Web, WhatsApp, and Chrome extension
- The original **Jotter - Notes Writing App** is being discontinued
- **One Jotter** is free with unlimited notes

This name is extremely crowded in the exact use case we need. An AI-powered "Jotter" note-taking app already exists.

---

### Search: site:play.google.com "Utterance" app

**Essentially empty.** No apps named "Utterance" found on the Play Store. Results were:
- Japanese language training apps (in Japanese, with "utterance" in descriptions)
- Books about utterance/language on Google Play Books
- One app (Ek Fota Kathamrita) that mentions "utterance" in its description

**Verdict: VERY CLEAR.** No apps use "Utterance" as their name on the Play Store.

---

### Search: "Utterance" android app play store

Confirmed. No Android app named "Utterance" exists. The only relevant result was:
- **utterances** (utteranc.es) - a GitHub-based commenting system for websites, not a mobile app at all
- Various text-to-speech and speech recognition articles that use "utterance" as a technical term

The name is completely unclaimed in the app space. The word "utterance" appears only as a technical term in speech/NLP contexts, not as an app brand.
